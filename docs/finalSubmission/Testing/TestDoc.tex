\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Purpose of Document}
The purpose of this document to document and demonstrate that our Checkers game design and functionality
aligns with the requirements outlined in the referenced requirement document. This document includes validation and testing
of all possible scenarios by defining accepting states and noting the actual outcome of each respective case.

\section{Scope of Document}
The scope of this document encompasses the three phases that are each unique parts in our overall game procedure. We chose to separate our tests into three phases because they are each independent in that they encapsulate similar tests, yet are dependent on each other via a linking action or procedure.
This document will try to justify that our design has been tested and meets the entire specifications of our requirements, and will report any bug that exists within our testing suite.

\section{References}
All required references can be found in the preceding document at the terminal end. Most of these references will point towards are design and requirements document, which have been previously submitted.

\chapter{Testing Environment}
This section has brief information about the system environment where the test suite was performed and the
information of the tester.

\chapter{Testing Environment Setup and Prerequisites}

Prerequisite
\begin{itemize}
  \item This game has implemented a Java Swing GUI for interaction. Java 12.0 is needed on the target system in order for the user to properly see the UI without any issues.
  \item Just for testing purpose, our program can be tested on a single, localhost machine. For multiplayer games with other devices, a stable Internet connection is needed.
  \item A Drexel Account is required to interact with the lobby structure to satisfy the tests conditions.
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Test Cases}

This chapter is divided into four sections, each respective to each phase of the game. The first phase includes the launching portion of the game, as well as interacting with the key menus to launch lobbies. The second phase tests the validation and logic of gameplay. The Third phase, while small, tests the functionality of multiple sessions running concurrently in conjuncture with the server. Finally, the fourth phase tests win conditions and outlying cases. If a test is Work-In-Progress, this means we are crafting the test suite or finalizing the components used in the testing mechanism.

\section{Test Phase 1: Starting Game}

\subsection{Description}
This section covers the testing of the initial phase of launching the program, creating a lobby, joining a lobby and starting a new game. This section relies heavily on UI interaction with our Swing menus.
\subsection{Prerequisites for this test case} An internet connection with a firewall rule allowing traffic on all ports, to be certain, is required to this phase. Localhost also works just fine, as long as two sessions are able to run on the target machine with no drawbacks.

\end{tabu}

\section{Test Phase 2: Gameplay Validation}

\subsection{Description}
This section covers the testing of the gameplay validation system. This includes the testing of game moves, moves that are valid and invalid, jumps, and the process of king generation. These requirements to which they match up are mostly in the 6.2 Gameplay section of our requirements documentation. Finally, we want to make the distinction that we want to test the end-facing client, because that is the product we are sending as our deliverable. 

\subsection{Prerequisites for this test case}
A valid lobby that has been initialized for an in-progress game. Note, we will be talking about the server validation of clients disconnecting and other similar processes in the next phase. For reference, we will be posting a picture of the board below, so you, the reader, can have a graphical representation to what we are talking about.

\end{tabu}


\section{Test Phase 3: Multiple}

\subsection{Description}
This section covers the testing of the proper game performance of multiple sessions running at the same time. Most of our server tests are in this phase below, as they are independent of the client tests. The cases where they match are detailed in the final phase, along with the win conditions.

\subsection{Prerequisites for this test case}
More than one game lobby running for these tests to work. An active server must also be running on Drexel's network in order to properly achieve network results.

\subsection{Scenario}
\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {| c | X | X | X | X | X |}
\hline
\textbf{Item No.} & \textbf{Case} & \textbf{Expectation} & \textbf{Actual Outcome} & \textbf{Requirement Reference}\\ \hline
1 & Lobby only sends activity between two fixed clients & Only changes in the game state should be seen between two clients and should not interfere other session game play &  Passed  & L2.3 \\ \hline
2 & Client has poor network connection & Server should automatically alert the client connection &  Failed - left out  & N1.4\\ \hline
3 & Client can't connect to the server within a reasonable time & Server should automatically close the requested connection & Failed - left out & N2.4 \\ \hline
4 & Server shuts down unexpectedly & All lobbies are warned gracefully of the shutdown & Failed, lobbies not warned gracefull & L2.4 \\ \hline
5 & Lobby concludes the game & No other lobbies should be opened or closed in any way & Passed & L2.5 \\ \hline
6 & Server starts back up after it terminated with lobbies active & No lobbies will be re-created as clients have disconnected & Passed & N2.3 \\ \hline
\end{tabu}

\section{Test Phase 4: Ending the game}

\subsection{Description}
This section covers the testing of the scenario when the game ends and all possibilities of further action that can be taken from the clients.

\subsection{Prerequisites for this test case}
At least one lobby in the active state, with the game in progress. Two clients are required for each of these test cases.

\subsection{Scenario}
\begin{tabu} to \textwidth {| c | X | X | X | X | X |}
\textbf{Item No.} & \textbf{Case} & \textbf{Expectation} & \textbf{Actual Outcome} & \textbf{Requirement Reference}\\ \hline
1 & Piece makes a winning jump & If a piece makes a valid jump over the last piece, then that player should be declared the winner &  Passed  &6.2.1 \\ \hline
2 & Game Concludes & Player who won should receive the winner message, loser should receive the opposite message & Passed  &6.2.1 \\ \hline
3 & Client want to leave the lobby & Once a client quits the lobby, they should be returned to the lobby screen&  Failed - left out  &6.2.2 \\ \hline
4 & Client leaves the lobby & The other connected client to the lobby is declared the winner  & Failed - left out  &6.2.2 \\ \hline
5 & After game is finished, both players want a rematch & A new lobby will be created with the same two clients & Failed - left out  &6.2.2 \\ \hline
6 & After game is finished, if one player doesn't want a rematch & Both players will return to the lobby screen & Failed - left out & 6.2.2\\ \hline
