\chapter{Testing Environment Setup and Prerequisites}

Prerequisit
\begin{itemize}
  \item This game has GUI for interaction and for that at least Java 12.0 is needed on the system
  \item Just for testing purpose it can be test on single machine but for crossplatform Internet is needed
  \item Active Internet connection so it player can connet to server and play over Tux
\end{itemize}

\chapter{Test Cases}

This section is divided into four sections where it tests the game into four phases, the first phase include the launching phase of the game,
second phase test the validation of gameplay, third small phase test the functionality of multiple session of game and the last phase of testing includes the end of the game. 

\section{Test Phase 1: Starting Game}

\subsection{Description}
This section covers the testing of the initial phase of launching a game, creating a session and starting a new game.

\subsection{Prerequisites for this test case}
An internet connection regardless of testing between multiple entities, or single in order to connect to server.

\subsection{Scenario}

\hline
\textbf{Number} & \textbf{Case} & \textbf{Expectation} & \textbf{Actual Outcome} & \textbf{Steps} & \textbf{Requrienment Refrence}\\ \hline
1 & Launch the game & GUI of Lobby menu should be launched &  &  & \\ \hline
