	Short and sweet: First, run the server jar on tux2. Then, run the client jar to connect to the server running.

### Running the Client
   - ```java -jar client-{version}.jar```

### Running the Server
   - ```java -jar server-{version}.jar```
   
## Development Notes

   - You can import the project via IntelliJ or Eclipse as a gradle project.
   
## Testing Notes
